# Minimum Vertex Cover Project
Group project: use 4 algorithms to solve Minimum Vertex Cover Problem
## Data
- Given 13 graph files
## Walk through the code files
- main.py: determine what algorithm to use depending on user input
- BnB.py: Branch and Bound 
- Approx.py: Approximation 
- LS1.py: Simulated Annealing 
- LS2.py: Edge Weighting with Configuration Change
## Output
- solutoin files
- trace files
- [report](https://github.com/TJ-HOU/MVC/blob/main/6140_project_report.pdf)
